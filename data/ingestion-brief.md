## 5. Risk & Policy Signals
- Retention grant before SOP vote - High impact, cite cit_bor_retention.
- CEO pay vs TSR misalignment - Medium impact, cite cit_aur_p4p.
- Metric definitions stale - Low impact, cite cit_bor_policy.

Recommended remediation:
1. Tie the AI Momentum PSU vesting to TSR quartiles or rescind prior to vote.
2. Communicate AI KPI uplift and TSR bridge in the board deck.
3. Adopt ISS 2026 ESG scoring language in metrics disclosure.
